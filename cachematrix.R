# With these two functions you can compute the inverse of a matrix efficiently
# makeCacheMatrix adds the capability to cache the inverse of your matrix
# cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the matrix created with makeCacheMatrix


# creates an 'object' that contains the matrix and its inverse

# Returns the inverse of the matrix x computeted in efficient way,
# if it is already present in cache the calculation will be skipped
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
